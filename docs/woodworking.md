## Wood (lumber)

* [Flat (plain) vs Quarter sawn](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cffdfdd7a7d7700013ba738/t/5d49a844d997fc00010dbab6/1565108292329/diagram-log-straight-quarter-plain-sawn-grain.jpg)

### Cost of wood

* [Board Feet vs Linear Feet. How to Calculate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54aU0qBSNiY) (Video)
* [Lumber calculator](https://www.homeadvisor.com/r/lumber-calculator/)

**Sold by:**

* Linear foot: The length of a given board
* Board foot: Thickness * Width * Length. Measure in inches, then divide by 144 (144 inches³ = 1 board foot).
* MBF: 1000(mili)-board-feet

Lumber sold by linear foot is usually more expensive than lumber sold by board foot.

**Nominal vs actual size**

* 2-by-4 is actually 1½" thick by 3½" wide
* 2-by-8 is actually 1½" thick by 7¼" wide

The length measurement is the always the same.
