## Betaflight modes

Switch | Description
--- | ---
SA | Arm
SB | Flight modes: ↑ Angle, -	Horizon, ↓	Acro
SE | Flip over after crash (Turtle mode)
SF | Prearm
S1 | Backlight
S2 | Volume
SW1 | Beeper
SW2 | Telemetry
SW3 | OSD Disable
SW4 | Camera control 1
SW5 | Camera control 2
SW6 | Camera control 3

### Flight Modes

Switch | Mode | How it flies | Stick behavior
--- | --- | --- | ---
SB ↑ | Angle | Self-Leveling. The drone snaps back to level when you release the sticks. | Great for takeoff and landing. Limited tilt angle (the drone cannot flip over)
SB - | Horizon | Hybrid. Self-levels at center sticks, but allows flips at full deflection. | Best for practicing your first flips without losing control
SB ↓ | Acro (Manual) | The drone stays at the angle you set. No self-leveling. | This is the "standard" FPV experience

## Express LRS modes

Switch | Description
--- | ---
SC | Throttle: ↑ 50%, -	75%, ↓	100%
SD | Roll, Pitch, Yaw: ↑ 50%, -	75%, ↓	100%

## How-tos

### Configure S1 and S2 encoders on RadioMaster TX15 Radio Controller

1. Press "SYS" on the RC
1. Press "PAGE>" to navigate to th Global functions section
1. Set GF1 to Backlight on S1
1. Set GF2 to Volume on S2
1. Set GF3 to RacingMode on SD↓

### Configure dynamic motor idle

1. Navigate to the "Motors" tab in Betaflight
1. n.b. Take off the props to prevent the drone from moving
1. Plug in a battery and use the "Master" slider to spin the motors at exactly 5.5% (1055 on the slider)
1. Divide the RPM number by 100
1. Navigate to the "PID Tuning" tab and set the value above (e.g. 90) as the "Dynamic Idle Value"

From the Betaflight CLI, execute:

```text
set dshot_idle_value = 0
set dyn_idle_min_rpm = 90
set transient_throttle_limit = 0
save
```

Take that RPM number, divide by 100, and enter that as your Dynamic Idle Value.

### Configure ExpressLRS transmission settings on a RadioMaster TX15 Radio Controller

1. Ensure the drone is not bound (is off)
1. Press "SYS" on the RC to navigate to the SYS>Tools section
1. Press "ExpressLRS"
1. Set Packet rate: 333 Full 2.4G, and Switch Mode: 12ch Mixed.

**Notes**

* Channels 1-4: Are sent at full resolution (the sticks: Pitch, Roll, Yaw, Throttle). Channel 5 (AUX 1): Is the Arm switch. Channels 6-12: Are sent in a "mixed" format, which allows for the use of 3-position switches.
* "Full" mode sends high-resolution data for all channels.

If you need more than 12 channels, then set Switch Mode: 16ch Rate/2, which enables more switches, but cuts the update speed in half.

### Bind RadioMaster TX15 Radio Controller to ExpressLRS receiver

n.b. If the green light on the flight controller is flashing, then that means the RC isn't connected to the receiver. If it's flashing then the RC is connected to the receiver.

1. Connect a USB cable from your computer to the flight controller. The green light on the Express LRS receiver should be flashing.
2. Unplug and plug it in 3 times in quick succession. The green light on the Express LRS receiver should be solid.
3. Click the SYS button on the RC
4. Navigate to ExpressLRS, and scroll down
5. Click "Bind"

### Flash ExpressLRS onto TX15

1. Press the "SYS" button on the RC
1. Select the "ExpressLRS" Lua script
1. Select "Enable WiFi"
   * The radio screen will display "WiFi Running" and show the SSID (ExpressLRS TX) and Password (expresslrs).
1.  Open the ExpressLRS Configurator.
1. Select the latest 3.x.x Release
   * Device Category: RadioMaster 2.4 GHz
   * Device: RadioMaster TX15 Internal 2.4GHz TX (or the matching internal target).
   * Flashing Method: WIFI
1. Enter your Binding Phrase (Mandatory for easy pairing with your Pavo Pico II) and your Regulatory Domain (e.g., ISM_2400).
1. Click Build & Flash

### Flash Betaflight firmware

1. Enter "DFU" mode by holding the physical "Boot" button on the Flight Controller while plugging in the USB
   * Alternative methods: The following two methods do not work on older FC firmwares
     * Alternative method 1: Navigate to the "Setup" section, and click "Activate Boot Loader / DFU"
     * Alternative method 2: Execute `bl` in the Betaflight CLI
   * On the Pavo Pico II, the boot button is on the side of the Flight Controller PCB that doesn't have any LEDs / on the same side as the USB port adapter; it's a tiny button on the far side of the PCB away from the USB port adapter.
   * When in DFU mode, the port dropdown in the top-right of Betaflight (shown when the USB cable is plugged in, but Betaflight is disconnected) should display "DFU - STM32 BOOTLOADER" instead of e.g. `/dev/ttyACM0`.
1. Click "Update Firmware" on the top-right of Betaflight
1. Navigate to the to the "Firmware Flasher" section
1. Select a board, e.g. BETAFPVF405
   * While in normal mode, you can also click "Auto-detect" to populate this dropdown
1. Select the version to flash, e.g. "4.5.3 [23-Nov-2025]"
1. Enable "Full chip erase"
1. Click "Load Firmware [Online]"
1. Click "Flash Firmware"
   * If after rebooting and reconnecting, you see an error like "The configurator version used (10.10.0) does not support firmware 25.12.2", then you must downgrade to an older firmware version. The latest version of BETAFPVF405 firmware supported by configurator 10.10.0 is "4.5.3 [23-Nov-2025]".

When you connect your flight controller, Linux sees two completely different USB devices depending on whether the board is in "Normal" mode or "DFU" (Bootloader) mode.

**Normal (default) mode `dmesg` log:**

```text
1060799.769020] usb 7-1.4.3: new full-speed USB device number 111 using xhci_hcd
[1060799.929909] usb 7-1.4.3: New USB device found, idVendor=0483, idProduct=5740, bcdDevice= 2.00

[1060799.929918] usb 7-1.4.3: SerialNumber: 0x8000000
```

In this state, you can configure the drone, but you cannot flash new firmware.

**DFU mode `dmesg` log:**

```text

[1060823.255948] usb 7-1.4.3: SerialNumber: 366837633135
```

In this state, you can flash new firmware, but you cannot configure the drone.
