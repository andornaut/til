## systemctl commands

[man systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.html)
[Docs](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units)

```
# Reload unit files
$ systemctl daemon-reload

# Start service on boot
$ systemctl enable $service

# Show units
$ systemctl list-units
$ systemctl list-units --state=failed
$ systemctl list-units --type=mount

# List dependencies
$ systemctl list-dependencies $service
```

## journalctl commands

```
# Tail logs for a service
$ journalctl -f -u $sevice
```
## User units

Add unit files to `~/.config/systemd/user/`. eg

```
[Unit]
Description=Music Player Daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/mpd --no-daemon

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

The default target is "default.target"

User units cannot depend on system units.

```
# Commands are similar to the system-wide systemctl, except that they do not require sudo.
$ systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### Lingering

[man loginctl](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/loginctl.html#enable-linger%20USER...)

> The user@.service is started automatically when the user first logs in, and stays around as long as at least one login session is open. After the user logs out of the last session, user@.service and all services underneath it are terminated. This behavior is the default, when "lingering" is not enabled for that user. Enabling lingering means that user@.service is started automatically during boot, even if the user is not logged in, and that the service is not terminated when the user logs out.

> Enabling lingering allows the user to run processes without being logged in, for example to allow screen to persist after the user logs out, even if the session scope is terminated. In the default configuration, users can enable lingering for themselves:

```
$ loginctl enable-linger ${USER}
```
